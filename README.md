Hello everyone,

I am a new programmer. I like to do coding and solve problems. I am studying at Red Deer Polytechnic. My subject is Network Administration. Currently, we are studying about java. Here I will share what my instructor will teach us and what he will give us as an assignment. 

Thank You!
