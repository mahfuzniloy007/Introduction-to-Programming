/*Create a class named Apartment that holds an apartment number, number of
bedrooms, number of baths, and rent amount. Create a constructor that accepts
values for each data field. Also create a get method for each field. Write an
application that creates at least five Apartment objects. Then prompt a user to enter
a minimum number of bedrooms required, a minimum number of baths required,
and a maximum rent the user is willing to pay. Display data for all the Apartment
objects that meet the userâ€™s criteria or an appropriate message if no such apartments
are available. Save the files as Apartment.java and TestApartments.java. */
